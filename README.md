Hi! I'm Érika Full-Stack and now I present to you a form project for a newsletter

<h2>About the proyect</h2>

<p>I present to you a registration form where you can find different technical aspects: </p>
📝 You have different checkboxes where you can enter your personal data.<br>
⭕ I have used the radio function to be able to choose between the options that the form gives us.<br>
📅 I have added a drop-down menu where you can choose the day of the week.<br>
✏️ I have placed a textarea where I can put the user's option.
<br>
<br>
You have two buttons: one to check the form and another to delete the information.
<br>
THANKS 🫰
